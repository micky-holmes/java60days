Java60Days is my personal 60-day Java refresher project.
Each day I complete exercises covering core Java topics, while also practising Git, unit testing, and CI/CD workflows. 
The repo is wired up with GitHub Actions (build + test), JaCoCo coverage reports, and fun extras like ASCII build celebrations.
